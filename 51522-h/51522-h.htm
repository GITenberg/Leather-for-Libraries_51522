<p>The section of the leather trade to which this
Handbook relates is that concerned in the manufacture
of light leathers tanned with a pale tannage
preparatory to being dyed. Bark and most other
vegetable tanning substances leave a colour on the
skin which cannot be removed without detriment to
the durability of the leather; the retention of the
colour, however, detracts from the purity of the final
colour imparted by the dye. The reputation in the
past of the sumach-tanned Spanish leather was founded
upon this peculiar property of sumach of leaving the
skin white, and on this point the wisdom of the
ancients has been justified by the results of an exhaustive
series of experiments conducted by the Society of
Arts&#8217; Committee, which have given to sumach the first
place in the list of tannages for light leathers.</p>

<p>The date of the introduction of sumach tanning
into England may, with some show of probability, be
assigned to the year 1565, when a seven years&#8217; monopoly
patent was granted to two strangers, Roger Heuxtenbury
and Bartholomew Verberick, for the manufacture of
&#8220;Spanish or beyond sea leather,&#8221; on the condition that
the patentees should employ one native apprentice for
every foreigner in their service. This stipulation indicates
that the industry was a new one. Following the
custom of the times, the supervision of the industry was
entrusted to the &#8220;Wardens of the Company of Leathersellers
in London.&#8221; Additional evidence of the use of
sumach at this period is afforded by another patent to
a Spanish Jew, Roderigo Lopez, one of Elizabeth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>&#8217;s
physicians. By way of settling her doctor&#8217;s bills the
Queen granted to Lopez, in 1584, an exclusive licence
to import sumach and aniseed for ten years. Besides
attending the Queen in his professional capacity, Lopez
was called upon to act as interpreter to the Portuguese
pretender, Don Antonio, on his visit to this island. As
the result of some misunderstanding with Antonio, Lopez
was induced to join a conspiracy nominally aimed against
the life of Antonio, but actually directed against the
Queen, and in 1594 Lopez expiated his crimes at Tyburn.
Those who are curious in such matters will be interested
to trace in the &#8220;Merchant of Venice&#8221; the re-appearance
of our sumach merchant as Shylock, while the name of
Antonio is boldly retained by Shakespeare for his hero
(Cf. S. Lee, &#8220;The Original of Shylock,&#8221; in the <i>Gentleman&#8217;s
Magazine</i>, 1880). After the arrest of Lopez, his grant
was continued to R. Alexander and R. Mompesson (Patent
Roll, 36 Eliz., p. 11). In the Charter of the Leathersellers&#8217;
Company, dated 1604, &#8220;Spanish leather and other
leathers dressed or wrought in sumach or bark&#8221; are
mentioned. In 1660 the duty granted upon imported
sumach was fixed at 13s. 4d. per cwt. of 112 lbs., and on
dried myrobalans at 1s. 3d. per lb., thus disproving the
statement of Prof. Thorold Rogers in his &#8220;History of
Prices&#8221; (Vol. 5, p. 414), that oak bark was the only
tanning material used in England at this period. The
earliest description known to the writer of the process
of sumaching by sewing up the skins into bottles and
allowing the fluid extract to penetrate the fibre by
pressure, is to be found in 1754 in the &#8220;Dictionary of
Arts and Science&#8221; (Vol. 3, article &#8220;Morocco&#8221;).</p>

<p>The first step in the degradation of the manufacture
of light leathers, though it at first affected the heavy
leathers only, was the introduction of the use of sulphuric
acid in 1768 by Dr. McBride of Dublin (<i>Phil.
Trans.</i>, 1778). By substituting a vitriolic liquor for
the vegetable acids obtained by fermenting bran, rye, or
other cereals, Dr. McBride claimed three advantages:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
(1) Absolute control over the degree of acidity of the
liquor, whereas organic souring was troublesome and
uncertain; (2) that the skins were &#8220;plumped&#8221; better
by the acid, and that the danger of injury to skins (by
bacterial action) was avoided; (3) that the process of
tanning was materially shortened. At all events, the
Doctor succeeded in convincing first the Dublin tanners,
and shortly afterwards their Bermondsey rivals, of the
superiority of his methods, which, as already stated, were
intended for heavy leathers only (<i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>,
1797, article &#8220;Tanning&#8221;).</p>

<p>Having once established its footing in the tanyard
the use of sulphuric acid was soon further extended.
With the introduction of aniline dyestuffs about 1870
sulphuric acid came into universal use as a means of
clearing the skin before entering the dyebath. The
effect of the introduction of the coal-tar colours was to
revolutionise the dyeing of leather. Under the old
<i>régime</i> of the vegetable dyestuffs the few standard shades
of red, blue, olive, yellow, and black were obtained on
moroccos mordanted with alum, while bark-tanned calf
and sheep skins were, as a rule, left in their natural
browns and ornamented by sprinkling or marbling. The
wide range of colours offered by the new dyestuffs fascinated
the public, which accepted the new leathers
without question as to their durability. Librarians
began to insist upon accuracy and uniformity of shade,
regardless of the methods by which these results were
obtained. Yet, apart from the question of durability, it
is clear that brilliancy of colour has been purchased at
too high a price. Under the old system of dyeing a
thin superficial layer of colour was laid over the natural
white of the skin, thereby obtaining a variety and depth
of colour which is in striking contrast to the dead
uniformity of the colours of modern acid-bitten leathers.
Hence the reform of the manufacture of the light
leathers is supported by æsthetic as well as by practical
considerations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing from the domain of chemistry to that of
mechanics, the Committee of the Society of Arts has
emphasized the need of a return to sounder and less
ruinous methods of dealing with leather; but their recommendations
are so clearly set out in their Report
that it is proposed here to touch upon one point only,
viz., the artificial graining of leather. The Committee
remark that, whereas many examples of sound sheepskin,
dating from the 15th century to the early part of the
19th century, had been brought to their notice, &#8220;since
about 1860 sheepskin as sheepskin is hardly to be found.&#8221;
Now, the decoration of leather by the impression of
patterns by mechanical pressure had long been known,
the lozenge pattern of early russia leather having been
effected in the 18th century by means of engraved steel
cylinders. But in 1851 it occurred to an ingenious
mechanic that, by means of the electroplate process, an
exact reproduction of the grain of the higher-priced skins
might be communicated to sheepskin or other inferior
leather whereby the selling value of the latter would be
considerably enhanced (Cf. Bernard&#8217;s Patent Specification
13,808 of 1851, and a modification of the same
process in No. 2,391 of 1855). From this date, therefore,
sheepskin disappears from view only to reappear as imitation
morocco, pigskin, or other higher-priced leather.
So perfectly does the counterfeit skin imitate the original
on the bound volume that the two can only be distinguished
with certainty by microscopic examination.
Librarians, therefore, must bear in mind that a familiarity
with the natural characteristics of the ordinary binding
leathers is no safe guide to the character of the leather
of a binding. The utmost that can be said is that the
leather is either genuine or else a remarkably good
counterfeit, a conclusion which, it is hardly necessary to
say, is not one of great value in practice.</p>

<p>As might have been supposed, the rapid decay of
leather bindings in the 19th century, resulting from a
combination of the above malpractices, with the attendant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
evils of heavy outlay upon rebinding, cropped margins,
and ill-matched sets upon the shelves, from time to
time attracted the attention of booklovers and bookbinders;
but their efforts to determine the causes of the
deterioration and to find a remedy have until recently
met with very little success. In 1842 the subject was
investigated by Professors Faraday, Brande, and others
on behalf of the Athenæum Club. This committee is
largely responsible for the &#8220;sulphur in gas&#8221; theory&mdash;a
theory which was never wholly true, even at a period
when the percentage of sulphur in coal gas was much
higher than at present (Cf. <i>Journal of the Society of Arts</i>,
1850-59, p. 215), and which now has ceased to have any
practical bearing upon the matter. It should be noted
that, in 1851, Crace Calvert, the well-known Manchester
chemist, came to a different conclusion. After pointing
out that decay in leather was observable in libraries, such
as the Chetham Library, in which gas had never been used,
he stated that the presence of sulphuric acid in leather
bindings was attributable to one or more of three causes:
(<i>a</i>) to the pollution of the atmosphere by consumption
of coal in the Manchester factories; (<i>b</i>) to the action
of gas fumes in unventilated rooms; (<i>c</i>) to the use of
sulphuric acid by the tanners; and he further expressed
his opinion that the seat of the disease would be found in
irregularities in the processes of tanning&mdash;in other words,
that the disease was aggravated rather than originated
by these first two causes (Cf. <i>Trans. Society of Arts</i>,
Vol. 51, pp. 120-22). Calvert&#8217;s views, however, met with
very little support. In 1877, at the Conference of
Librarians in London, a proposal was made that a
committee of librarians and chemists should deal with
the matter, but no effect was given to the proposal. Ten
years later a series of experiments on the action of gas
fumes and heat was undertaken on behalf of the Birmingham
Library by Mr. C. T. Woodward (<i>Library Chronicle</i>,
1887, pp. 25-29). Strips of leather exposed for 1,000
hours to the action of gas fumes, at temperatures of 130°<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and 140° Fahrenheit, showed a mean absorption of sulphuric
acid of 1·78 per cent., accompanied by a marked
reduction in their stretching capacity and breaking strain.
The experiments on the action of heat alone were regarded
as inconclusive. Mr. Woodward suggested that
the Library Association should undertake the testing of
leathers, and that librarians should thereafter employ
only leather of a given standard; but once more nothing
was done. In the meantime the reputation of leather as
a binding material continued to dwindle; one leather after
another was tried, found wanting, and excluded from
library practice, while various leather substitutes&mdash;buckram,
art linen, and imitation leathers, gradually took its
place. It is due to the efforts of Dr. Parker and Prof.
Procter between 1898 and 1900 that the real facts of the
case have been brought to light. In the latter years an
agitation in favour of standard leather was set on foot by
Lord Cobham, Mr. Cockerell, Mr. Davenport, and others,
which resulted in the appointment by the Society of Arts
of a Committee on Leathers for Bookbinding, the cost
of which was met by a grant from the Leathersellers&#8217;
Company.</p>

<p>Upon the publication of the first report of the above
Committee in 1901 the subject was taken up by the Council
of the Library Association, and after several papers had
been read at the monthly meetings in London and elsewhere,
a Committee was appointed to ascertain how far
Members of the Association were prepared to accept a
common standard for binding leathers. For this purpose in
March 1904, close upon 1,000 circulars were addressed to
the libraries of the United Kingdom asking for a statement
of their views upon the following proposals, amongst
others, viz.: (<i>a</i>) that the Council should appoint an official
analyst; (<i>b</i>) that they should publish a handbook giving
to members of the Association such information as would
enable them to secure sound leather at a reasonable
price. The circular meeting with a favourable reception,
the Council invited Dr. Parker to draw up a scale of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
fees for the analysis of leathers, and the scale having
been duly approved, Dr. Parker was at once appointed
analyst to the Association.</p>

<p>Since the appointment of the Committee abundant
evidence has been forthcoming that at last the reform of
light leathers for bookbinding and upholstery is now in
sight. The efforts of the Committee have been warmly
seconded by the Press. In the recently concluded Government
binding contracts a clause has been inserted enabling
any department to obtain standard leather and rendering
the contractor liable to heavy penalties for infringement
of the conditions of this clause; yet the price paid for
bindings in this leather is only fractionally increased.
From the outset the Committee have been assured of
the support of the leading firms of leather manufacturers,
who have recognised that, if leather is to regain the
ground which has been lost, it must be by the adoption
of a common standard of manufacture and by the introduction
of honest trade descriptions in the retail trade.</p>

<p>Hence where the provenance of the leather is declared
and the method of its manufacture supported by a written
guarantee from the leather manufacturer, the need for
periodical analysis of samples is less urgent. But where
the bookbinder is unwilling or unable to state the provenance
of his leathers recourse to chemical analysis is
the only safeguard. The librarian on his side will
materially assist the binder by limiting his demand to
leathers of a few standard shades and by abstaining from
insisting upon accurate matching to pattern. If the
piecing, panelling and lettering of serials is kept uniform,
a want of uniformity in the shade of leather is not of
much practical moment. In the meantime the librarian
should keep a vigilant watch for the following symptoms
of deterioration:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>(<i>a</i>) General shabbiness and tenderness of leather,
especially at parts where the leather is strained
over the cords on the back or edges of the
boards. Probable cause: Sulphuric acid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Red rot in morocco. On friction the leather turns
to a red powder. Probable cause: A Persian
or East Indian half-bred sheepskin has been
supplied in place of goat.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Withering of pigskin accompanied by discoloration.
Probable cause: Over &#8220;pulling down&#8221;
of the skin in the &#8220;puering&#8221; process. If the
pigskin has been dyed in a bright shade, acid
also is present.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Deterioration and discoloration of smooth and
light-coloured calfskins, especially law calf.
Probable cause: Use of oxalic acid by the
bookbinder to remove grease marks, &amp;c.</p></blockquote>

<p>Why do modern leather bindings decay? Is it
possible to obtain a leather for bookbinding purposes
as good and as durable as the leather produced
from the 16th to 18th century? These are the two
problems which the Committee on Bookbinding Leather
appointed by the Society of Arts set themselves to investigate.
Fortunately we are able to solve both problems.</p>

<p>In the olden days all skins were tanned with a liquor
made from either oak bark or sumach, and in some cases
a mixture of the two. The skins used by the tanner were
usually obtained direct from the butchers. After soaking
and cleansing they were then limed for a period sufficiently
long to loosen the hair. After the removal of the hair
and superfluous flesh and fat, the skins were washed in
several changes of fresh soft water to remove the excess of
lime, the process being assisted by working the skins over
on a beam with a blunt knife. When in suitable condition
they were brought into sour, old tan liquors. There was
no hurry, the skins being slowly tanned in weak infusions,
and when the process was complete, the leather was simply
washed free from superfluous tan, dyed with wood or
other vegetable dyes, rinsed free from excess of dye-stuff,
and dried out. The leather was afterwards softened
by stretching, and polished or glazed by brushing the
skin over with oil, soap, beeswax, or a solution of
some moss. Such leather lacked the high finish, the
regular colour, the bright shades of modern leather, but
it lasted fifty or one hundred years with hard wear,
and, under favourable conditions, appears to be almost
imperishable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>The finish, or general appearance, of leather continued
to improve up to about 1850, but after that date some of
the bindings examined showed signs of rapid deterioration
in quality. This deterioration increased on bindings
subsequent to 1870, and probably 75 per cent. of the
leather used for bookbinding during the last twenty
years either has already decayed or will do so within a
comparatively short time.</p>

<p>Now to deal with the answer to the first question,
Why do modern leather bindings decay? The chief
causes are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. The introduction of tanning materials other than
oak and sumach, stronger in tanning, and more
rapid in their action. Many of these tanning
materials are unstable, and the leather produced
disintegrates on exposure to light and air.</p>

<p>2. The use of dried and cured skins of variable soundness
imported from abroad. Goat, calf, and
sheep skins are imported into this country from
all over the world; some are simply dried in the
sun, some salted, whilst others are cured with
various ingredients.</p>

<p>3. The use of infusions of acids and other bleaching
agents to produce bright and even shades of
colour.</p>

<p>4. The use of sulphuric or other mineral acids for the
purpose of developing the depth of colour during
the process of dyeing.</p>

<p>5. The shaving and splitting of skin for producing an
even substance.</p>

<p>6. Printing and embossing grains upon leather,
together with other methods of finishing now in
common use.</p>

<p>7. The stripping, scouring, souring, and re-tanning of
East India leathers (Persians).</p>

<p>8. The removal of the natural grease or nourishment
of the skin.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>These eight causes, although by no means exhaustive,
are, however, the chief factors in the deterioration of
modern leather; and in as few words as possible I will
explain the reason of their introduction and effect.</p>

<p>As the industry advanced there were found in different
parts of the world tanning materials other than oak and
sumach, some of which were two, three, or five times as
rich in tannin as oak, thus making infusions of greater
strength, and consequently of quicker action, with the
result that leather which formerly required from three to
six months to tan was turned out in almost as many days,
or, at the most, in as many weeks. It was not realised,
however, that these different tanning materials contained
tannins of different qualities, capable of producing quite
a different leather to that produced by means of oak or
sumach. The experts who spent months testing and
investigating this question came to the unanimous conclusion
that the speed of tannage or the strength of the
tanning liquor had very little to do with the wearing
qualities of the leather produced, but found that some
of these new materials contained tannins of a different
chemical nature from that of sumach, and that they
produced leather of an unstable character, some of the
leathers undergoing change in a few hours on exposure
to strong light and air. On the other hand, some of
the new tanning materials produced permanent leathers
practically equal to sumach. Those tanning materials,
therefore, which contained tannins of the catechol series,
including the tannins of hemlock, larch, quebracho,
mangrove, gambier, and turwar, were condemned, as all
these materials produce a leather which on exposure
to light and air turns first a red shade of colour and afterwards
develops what is now well known by bookbinders
and librarians as the red decay, where the leather crumbles
off on application of friction. On the other hand, tanning
materials of the pyrogallol class, such as sumach, galls,
divi-divi, myrobalans, oak, and chesnut, produce a leather
which is practically unaffected by light or air. Further,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
it was found in every case where authentic bindings dating
from the 13th century onwards were examined the tanning
material used was one of this pyrogallol series. On the
other hand, leathers which showed the red decay were
in every case found either to have been tanned with
tanning materials of the catechol series, or were rotted
with acid.</p>

<p>The second cause of trouble is the manufacture of
leather from skins from distant lands which have been
improperly or insufficiently preserved for export. It
often happens that the fibres have partly perished before
the tanner receives the skins, the resulting leather is
therefore poor, spongy, and partially perished, making
thin leather, which sometimes, on account of its thinness,
will cut up apparently economically for the binder,
but not economically for the librarian or the owner of
books, as the leather cannot possibly be as good or have
as long life as leather manufactured from a sound skin.</p>

<p>Bright even shades and light fancy colours previous
to the introduction of acid bleaches were manufactured
from sumach-tanned skins only, sumach alone producing
a leather of a light cream colour, and therefore capable
of taking practically any shade of dye. Most other
tanning materials produced dark foundations, on which
it was practically impossible to dye any but a dark shade.
Gradually, however, manufacturers found leather tanned
with materials cheaper than sumach could be scoured
and bleached with acids, then re-tanned with sumach,
thus producing a light, even-coloured leather, which with
the dye produced light shades. The cheapest, and at the
same time the most effective, acid for this purpose was
vitriol or sulphuric acid. This, in common with other
mineral acids, combines with the leather fibre, upon
which it exercises a most disastrous and disintegrating
action, and to the use of this acid, either as a bleaching or
clearing agent in the tanning process, or in subsequent use
in developing the colour in the dye-bath, may be ascribed
the cause of decay of over 90 per cent. of modern bookbinding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and upholstering leather. It is impossible to
remove these acids from leather by any subsequent amount
of washing, or without the addition of some other chemical
to expel them. Recently the writer treated some
leather with sulphuric acid, and after cutting the leather
up into small pieces, washed the same in running water
for three weeks; at the end of that period the sulphuric
acid was still tightly fixed in the fibres of the leather.</p>

<p>The introduction of aniline dyes instead of the older
process of wood dyes made a great change in the production
of bookbinding leather. Hundreds of new shades
of colour were produced, and the process of leather dyeing
was simplified and cheapened. But, unfortunately,
in the use of a certain class of these dye-stuffs the full
depth of shade could not at that date be produced upon
the leather except in the presence of an acid. Here,
again, therefore, sulphuric acid was introduced into the
leather during the process of manufacture, thus increasing
the proportion of leather which contained this
disintegrating material. It has frequently been stated
by leather dyers and others that a certain quantity of
sulphuric acid must be used with acid dye-stuffs, otherwise
the full depth of shade cannot be produced, and
they claim that without its use it is impossible to
produce certain brilliant shades of colour. These statements
have been proved to be devoid of foundation.
There are several substitutes for sulphuric acid which are
harmless in their nature. Among these I may mention
formic, acetic and lactic acids. These are organic acids
which have no harmful action on the leather; they are
easily washed out, and even if any trace of these acids
be left in the skin, they will evaporate. Formic acid
has even been proved to be cheaper than sulphuric, and,
moreover, is capable of developing equal shades in all
cases, and deeper and more brilliant shades of colour
with some dyes. For the present, however, bookbinders,
and especially librarians, are advised not to insist upon
brilliant shades of colour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>The introduction of the splitting machine and the
introduction of a machine for shaving leather has undoubtedly
tended to produce a large quantity of thin
leather, but it is impossible either to shave or to split
a skin without cutting the network of fibres, and the
strength of the leather cannot but be materially decreased.
Leather is made up of a complex system of fibres interweaving
and intertwining in every possible direction, and
even the small amount of paring carried out by the bookbinder
himself considerably impairs the strength and life
of the binding. How much more, therefore, does the
splitting and shaving that the tanner carries out in order
to bring the skin to an even substance destroy the strength
of the product.</p>

<p>Sufficient has been written on the printing of morocco,
seal, and pig grains upon skins of an inferior class, but it
cannot be too strongly pointed out to librarians that
the strength of embossed leather must be impaired when
it is realised how the embossing and printing is carried
out. The skins to be embossed are coated over in the wet
state with a mixture of dye, size, and other materials,
and are then passed between two hot electrotype rollers.
This embosses or prints upon the skin the required grain;
at the same time it glues the fibres of the leather together,
preventing the free run which good skins should possess,
and the heat dries up the leather, reducing its strength
very considerably.</p>

<p>I now come to the stripping, scouring, souring, and
re-tanning of leather. It is difficult to decide whether
more damage is done in this process or in the use of
mineral acids in the dye-bath; but it is certain that any
leather which is stripped of its natural tanning by use of
alkalies or bleached by an acid has lost at least 90 per
cent. of its wearing and lasting properties. Thousands of
dozens of skins in the rough tanned condition reach the
English market from India, Australia, New Zealand, and
other parts. These are tanned with quebracho, mimosa,
or some similar tanning material, whereas the Indian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
skins are nearly all tanned with turwar bark and are
of a reddish-fawn shade of colour. These are purchased
by the leather finishers, and are manufactured in England.
In order to get rid of the reddish colour they are first
soaked in water and afterwards drummed in a weak
solution of washing soda, borax, or some similar alkali.
This removes the uncombined tan from the skin, as well
as taking out the natural grease. The skins emerge from
the drum a dark mahogany colour; they are then washed
in water and afterwards soured in a sulphuric acid bath.
This bleaches the skin to a light bright shade. The
finisher then, in order to put back tannin into the skin
of a light colour, re-tans them in sumach or a mixture of
sumach and oak. They are now known as re-tanned
skins; and after drying, are dyed and finished in the
ordinary manner. The sheep and goat skins are sold as
roans or moroccos, as the case may be, and, as a rule, no
indication is given that these are re-tanned skins. The
re-tanned Indian skins, however, generally leave the
factory as persian roans or persian morocco, but as the
skins pass from the manufacturer to the merchant, from
the merchant to the small dealer, the word &#8220;persian&#8221;
is generally omitted, and they reach the bookbinder as
moroccos or roans, as the case may be. Now this is the
most important point for the binder. I would go so
far as to say that it should almost be a punishable
offence to use either persians or re-tanned skins for
bookbinding purposes, as such leather cannot possibly
last ten years if exposed to light and air. Not only has
the scouring and alkali a perishing effect upon the
leather, but it is afterwards made worse by the treatment
with acid, a bleach, and the further addition of acid to
the dye-bath; added to which the alkaline treatment
removes the natural grease or nourishment of the skin,
and it is well known to those engaged in the leather
trade that the strength and life of a leather is at least
doubled by a proper nourishment of the leather with a
suitable fat. Therefore, if the whole of the natural fat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
is removed, the leather rapidly dries, it loses its elasticity
and spring, the grain cracks, and after keeping in a dry
library for some time the backs break right off the books.</p>

<p>I have dealt with the eight chief causes of premature
decay, but before passing to the other part of this paper
I must also deal with the weaknesses of the bookbinder
as well as those of the leather manufacturer, and, for
reasons stated above, absolutely condemn the undue
paring of leather, the bleaching of leather by means of
oxalic acid, and the use of patent finishes and glares, the
composition of which is in most cases a mystery, many
of them containing acids, others containing drying
agents which have almost as injurious an action upon
leather as the vitriol used by the tanner.</p>

<p>To revert to my original thesis, it is not only possible
to obtain a leather as good as any leather manufactured
from the 16th to 18th century, but it is even possible to
get a better leather. Librarians, in drawing up their
binding specifications have only to do what the Controller
of H.M.&#8217;s Stationery Office is doing for the
libraries under his charge, viz., to provide under suitable
penalties that leathers supplied by the contractor shall
be equal to samples shown on pattern cards prior to
tendering for the contract, and in addition to insist
that such leathers shall conform to certain conditions laid
down in the Report of the Society of Arts&#8217; Committee on
Bookbinding, which may be summarised as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. The binder undertakes not to use stripped and
re-tanned leather, whether persians (East Indian
skins) or from elsewhere, or to use leather
embossed or grained artificially to resemble
morocco, pigskin, &amp;c.</p>

<p>2. He guarantees (or undertakes to produce the
guarantee of the firm supplying the leather)
that all skins supplied (1) are genuine as
described; (2) are tanned with pure sumach or
galls, or in the case of calf or sheep with
oak bark, or mixtures of oak bark and sumach;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
(3) that no mineral acid has been used either in
the process of tanning, bleaching, or dyeing,
and that the leather is free from acid or other
injurious ingredient; (4) that he will use no acid
to clear the leather in the process of binding.</p></blockquote>

<p>Before drafting his binding specification the librarian
would do well to consult the excellent &#8220;Note on Bookbinding&#8221;
by Mr. Douglas Cockerell, published by W. H.
Smith and Son, at the price of 1d. Special attention is
drawn to the difference of the cost in binding according
to Specification I. and II. of the Society of Arts&#8217;
Committee reproduced on pp. 20-22 of this pamphlet,
and to Mr. Cockerell&#8217;s remarks on pages 9, etc.</p>

<p>The above stipulations should not make any substantial
difference in price per volume to those libraries
which already have been using high-class leather tanned
in sumach, but librarians who have hitherto been content
with persians, re-tanned Australians, and other cheap
classes of leather must expect to pay a higher price
for leather, properly tanned and guaranteed to last.
Several large firms of high reputation, who are now
catering for the bookbinding trade, have already turned
out thousands of skins of a satisfactory nature. These
firms are not only anxious to fall in with the requirements
of the Society of Arts&#8217; Report, but are desirous of
removing the distrust which at present exists with regard
to leather, and to reinstate this article as being the
standard and natural covering for books. For permanent
wear, whether for books or other purposes, leather,
when properly prepared, is without a rival both for
appearance and durability. It is only for the cheaper
class of work that leather substitutes are formidable as
rivals.</p>

<p>With regard to strengths of various leathers, it is
somewhat difficult to lay down a hard-and-fast rule, but
in general terms it may be stated that the strongest
leather made is pigskin. The fibres are tough, somewhat
coarse, but of great strength. The only danger is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in the paring down of the skin previous to use in the
binding, and therefore, by reason of its thickness, it is
well to only use pigskin for the binding of large, heavy
volumes where a thick leather can be used without
detriment to the appearance of the book. Seal probably
comes next in strength. It is tougher than goat skin,
and, by reason of the quantity of natural grease which
these skins contain, will in most cases remain pliable and
wear longer than the average morocco. Seal is closely
followed by goat skin. A special feature of goat is the
hard grain which it possesses. This is specially to be
recommended where much frictional wear is given to the
book. Sheep and calf may be put on about the same
footing. Both are extremely pliable, but I think one
may safely state that books bound in sheepskin leather,
if that leather be from the cross breed, Welsh, or other
mountain sheep, will probably outlast calf skin. There
is no doubt that calf has got into disrepute largely on
account of the destructive processes used in the finishing
and production of the soft, smooth-grained calf, which
has of late years become so popular. Binders must
understand that the velvety finish can only be obtained
by an undue pulling down of the skin previous to the
tanning process or an undue paring on the part of the
binder. Both Russia leather and vellum, as binding
materials, have done good service in the past, but have
lost their old reputation for durability. For the present,
librarians are recommended to use these skins as little as
possible. A few words suffice to deal with skiver bindings.
These are the thin grain of sheep and sometimes calf,
and are at their best about equal in strength to thin notepaper,
their whole texture and fibrous structure having
been split off and their nature destroyed.</p>

<p>It must be understood that the deterioration of
leather is not only caused by faulty manufacture or
improper treatment in the dye-house or finishing shop.
Good bindings of sound leather are frequently destroyed
by the neglect of certain elementary precautions on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
part of the librarian. The subject is too large to deal
with fully in these pages, but librarians would do well
to study carefully the detailed report of the Society of
Arts&#8217; Committee. But the following elementary rules
should be observed:&mdash;Books should not be exposed to gas
fumes, or to the direct rays of the sun; the temperature
of the library should not exceed 70° F., the upper strata
should be well ventilated, and a thermometer should be
hung on the same level as the top shelves in order to
advise the librarian whether the temperature is being
kept within reasonable limits. Freedom from damp is,
of course, an essential condition of library architecture.</p>

<p>The question of leather preservative compositions is
dealt with in another chapter, but too much cannot be
said against the use of various decoctions which are sold
to librarians for coating and preserving leather bindings.
Many of these contain turpentine, which has a drying,
detrimental effect. Various other emulsions are on the
market, but although these give the leather a soft,
pleasant feel when applied, this soon dries up, the
leather becoming hard and liable to crack. There may
be some suitable ingredients for applying to leather
bindings, but I am of the opinion that if a library is
not allowed to get too hot, and a plentiful supply of pure,
dry air is always present, sound leather should require
no further preservative.</p>

<p>To correctly locate the sources of skin supply suitable
for bookbinding is not easy, in consequence of
original breeds having been transplanted to equally
suitable climes over the seas. In many cases purity
of breed has been maintained, while in the majority,
deterioration has set in, due to desire for heavier beasts:
therefore the purposes of this chapter will be best met
if original breeds are described and their general <i>habitat</i>
located. The animals which furnish skins suitable in
quality and quantity to meet the increasing demands
of to-day are: sheep, goat, calf, seal, and pig or hog.
Other animals may produce skins good for bookbinding,
but a description of the foregoing will afford ample
illustration.</p>

<p>The sheepskin takes first place in regard to quantity.
Probably more than two-thirds of modern commercial
bindings are represented by this much-abused skin,
which is frequently so skilfully manipulated as to
deceive even an expert, that it is not what it is represented
to be. After the pelt has been split or cut
in twain&mdash;the grain part after tanning being termed
&#8220;a skiver,&#8221; and the flesh after dressing designated
chamois&mdash;the former is so manipulated with dyes,
finishes, and embossing, that surface or grain detection
is extremely difficult, say, between a true morocco or
embossed skiver. Much of this so-called misrepresentation
has been created by the public, who order their
books to be covered in &#8220;leather,&#8221; which they are
pleased to think is morocco, or pig or seal, when reflection
should tell them that it cannot be genuine at
the price they have paid, often for book and binding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
complete. This &#8220;faking&#8221; is very largely accomplished
upon sheepskin, because it readily lends itself to such
alterations both by nature and price; but when such
leathers are employed they should be correctly described
by the binder. Sheepskins have a large place in the
commercial bookbinderies and affections of the public
at large, and there is no reason why they should not
only hold their ground, but succeed in displacing the
cloth imitations of leather; and, provided the skins are
selected from suitable breeds, they should find a place
in the binding of certain classes of books intended for

<p>The sheep as a family are divided into two classes:
the Upland and Lowland breeds. The Upland class
inhabit the mountain ranges, and while possessing a short
firm wool, have a mass of close thick hair underneath.
Their habits and life make the character of meat and
skin approach a goat nearer than any other animal.
The parent stock are the argali or wild sheep of the
Himalaya, and the &#8220;Musmon&#8221; of the Andes and Sierra
Nevadas. Fuller particulars will be found in the
&#8220;Royal Natural History,&#8221; by Richard Lydekker, B.A.,
F.R.S., Vol. 2, pp. 212 to 234. The Upland sheep of
to-day vary in purity or closeness to the parent stock
according to the source of supply. In certain Mongolian,
Arabian and Welsh sheep it is not easy to discriminate
between them and a true goat, after the wool has been
removed. It is the skins of such sheep that are suitable
for binding books in libraries where price and hard
wear are a consideration. Sheep-grazing countries
having high altitudes would be probable sources of supply
of such skins. Great Britain, through Wales, Cumberland,
Westmorland, and the Highlands of Scotland
provides many millions of skins a year to the cotton
spinning trade, for covering drawing rollers, an operation
calling for a hard-wearing grained skin.</p>

<p>In practice it has been found that sheepskins yield
the most lasting results when tanned slowly in oak-bark<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
liquors; the product is a tighter and more solid skin
than when tanned in sumach, though sumach may
be used in given cases, or a combination of both.
Commercially valued, the upland sheepskins sell at
prices varying from 2-1/2d. to 9d. per square foot, when
finished according to the Society of Arts&#8217; Bookbinding
Committee&#8217;s Report.</p>

<p>The Lowland breed, commonly known as domestic
sheep (Ovis aries) are found wherever there are grazing
lands. In sheep grazing, the graziers&#8217; &#8220;object&#8221; varies.
It may be the &#8220;wool or the flesh.&#8221; If the former, the
skin is usually unfavourable for binding purposes, while
if the latter, a large portion find their way to the
sheepskin splitters, who by machinery of considerable
delicacy split the skins into what are known in the
trade as grains and fleshes. The grains alone interest
us, being subsequently tanned into skivers. This class of
leather has its use in low-price trade bindings of flexible
character, and as such competes and compares in price
and durability successfully with any imitations.</p>

<p>To make skivers suitable in wearing qualities it is
advisable to take the plain dyed class, reasonably stout,
tanned in sumach, and dyed without mineral acid, dried
out with a little stretch left in, and if they are required
as tough as it is possible to obtain a grain, a little
nourishing material may be used to advantage. By
following these lines it will reduce the risk of imitations.
Though &#8220;paste grain,&#8221; "long grain," and &#8220;glazed
skivers&#8221; will still find a market among binders, they
must not be classed among the &#8220;Imitations.&#8221; Skivers
are sold from about 1d. to 5d. per square foot.</p>

<p>Before proceeding further it may be well to point
out that the skins from old or very young animals
should be avoided, although old animals are a rarity.
Exceptionally large skins in their class should be viewed
with suspicion, likewise very small ones. The former
may indicate weakness, and the latter want of maturity.
This must in practice have a general application.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>The goat (Genus Capra) finds most favour as furnishing
a suitable skin among binders. This animal, in the
proper sense of the word &#8220;goat&#8221; exclusive, belongs to
the Old World, being confined to the area north of the
southern flanks of the Himalaya, though one species is
found in Egypt and another in Abyssinia, but quite unknown
in the remainder of Africa. In America the
term &#8220;goat&#8221; is applied to our ruminant. While being
essentially a mountain animal, goat breeding has become
a business to-day throughout the world, which has been
laid under contribution to supply the enormous demand
which has been created during the past twenty years by
the chrome glacé kid manufacturers, one maker alone
requiring 5,000 dozen skins per diem to keep his factory
running full. The skins generally employed for book
purposes are the European and Northern African supplies,
though many other sources are equally suitable. Goat
skins, on account of their firm nature are best tanned
in pure sumach (Sicilian). Time has conclusively proved
this point. In the Rylands Library in Manchester
(Eng.) are two heavy volumes bound in plain undyed
sumach-tanned goat-skins which were bound in Spain
in the 16th century, and are to-day in a perfect state of
preservation. The Niger skins (mixed goat and sheep)
which have found favour among certain bookbinders are
produced from a breed of Egyptian goats, tanned and
prepared by Nigerian natives with a species of nut-galls
which gives them that peculiar close, tight feel, and when
such firmness is required in European stock it may be
equally effectively produced with oak bark. The large
proportion of so-called moroccos offered to-day are made
from skins tanned in East India with a catechol tannin.
It is unfortunate that this tannage has failed to withstand
the tests supplied by the Scientific Committee
appointed by the Society of Arts on Bookbinding
Leathers, because it excludes from the Binding Trade
a very useful and cheap supply of pretty looking and
feeling skin ready to hand for finishing in moroccos.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
While condemned for permanent library work&mdash;that is,
guaranteed leathers&mdash;the writer sees no reason why
such leathers may not safely be used for Lending Library
work, where the life of a binding is not expected to
run more than ten years, provided the surplus tan is
washed out and replaced by some nourishing material
(fat), and in all processes inorganic acids and alkalis are
avoided. Goat-skins differ from other animals mainly
in the pronounced grain formations, while the texture
of the skin is closer and firmer than a sheep, the grain
is harder, more scale like, the papillæ between which
the hair-holes are situate are most marked, and it is their
formation which produces during the operation of
&#8220;boarding&#8221; the grained morocco with its beautiful
nodules. If these nodules or grains are bold and large
it indicates a thick skin originally. Such grains cannot
be expected upon a thin skin&mdash;it implies either over-reduction
(shaving) in substance or embossing. Thin
skins will produce a small shortlike grain. If the grain
is fine on a large skin it may have been reduced too
much in substance, and thereby loses most of its
muscular structure and strength. It is necessary when
buying moroccos, which are not only expensive but are
expected to yield longevity and be hard wearing, to
obtain a manufacturer&#8217;s guarantee that the skins are
genuine goat (Genus Capra) and not mountain sheep
(Argali) or bastards, and that they have been prepared
in accordance with the Society of Arts&#8217; Report on
Bookbinding. In value the moroccos vary considerably
in price, according to substance, size, quality, and
character. The skins are generally bought in the dry
pelt state with hair on at per lb., the large, plump, well-flayed
skins commanding higher prices than less favoured
ones. In this state it is difficult to detect grain faults,
consequently to the manufacturer it is somewhat of a
speculation, and unless he is well informed in his trade
he stands to lose heavily. Generally speaking the prime
clear grains go into bright colours at higher prices than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
defective grains, which can be hidden by darker colour
with the aid of a suitable finish. For example, the colour
of the Niger skins previously referred to is an excellent
one for hiding grain defects. The amount of absolutely
perfect skins is small, but the remainder are good skins
in their class for half-bound work. The perfect skins
will realise up to 2s. 6d. per square foot, and according
to quality and colour the balance will range down to
8d. per square foot.</p>

<p>Calf skins have long been favoured for bookbinding,
but through much variety of tannages and faulty selection
of skins have been brought somewhat into disrepute for
permanent work, but if prepared by slow tanning in oak
bark or sumach there is no reason why they should not be
reinstated. Undoubtedly the calf is favoured by Nature
with the finest and silkiest grains of all animals, and
though too tender for rough usage, is nevertheless, if suitably
nourished, capable of standing greater wear than
it is credited with. Calf skins for bookbinding are the
product of the domestic ox (Bos taurus), and as this
useful animal is bred the world over, we are not wanting
in supplies, nor is one land more favoured than another.
If the principle is accepted that small books require small
thin skins, as the books increase in size so should the skins
and substance, a great difficulty will be overcome, because
in buying calf one of the fatal mistakes made is the stipulation
that large skins must be thin. If this is insisted
upon they must be split or shaved of all their muscular
tissue till merely the grain or skiver is left. A reasonable
amount of shaving is permissible, but splitting is
disastrous. Calf skins are invariably free from grain
faults, so that for delicate shades of colour they are
particularly suitable. The grain does not lend itself to
any very definite formation in boarding (graining), therefore
calf by preference should be left smooth. In the
raw state they are purchased by the pound, and such
cost being a governing factor in selling, the price when
finished may vary from 8d. to 1s. 8d. per square foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>The skins of seal (family Phocidæ) are most useful for
bookbinding, possessing special features, viz.: evenness
of quality throughout, there being no flanky or abdominal
parts, extremely durable and producing pretty grains
either coarse or fine, dependent upon the substance and
character of the skins. The sources of supply are Russia,
Norway, Spitzbergen, Greenland, Labrador, and Newfoundland,
the largest supply coming from the latter
place. Isolated supplies have been shipped from the
Falkland Islands and Antarctic. These are the true or
earless seals (family Phocidæ), commonly called hair
seals in contradistinction to the fur or eared seal (family
Otaridæ) which inhabit the Pacifics. As a leather for
bookwork when tanned with a pyrogallol tannage it is
soft and kind to the touch, having few equals and no
superiors. It is essentially a hard-wearing leather and
in this respect only equalled by certain classes of goat-skins
and pig or hog skins. The &#8220;grained&#8221; skins exhibit
a grain which sparkles in a manner which is peculiarly
characteristic and absent in other grained leathers. The
value of seal-skins, finished, ranges from 10d. to 2s. per
square foot. The former are useful for half-bound books.</p>

<p>Finally, pig or hog skins have played an important
part in ancient bindings of all sizes, and proved their
great value as a hard wearing cover by coming down to
us in a remarkable state of preservation, even on very
heavy tomes. But, regretfully, some discredit has been
cast upon this splendid skin, partly due to ignorance in
manufacture, also to the very clever imitations. It is,
perhaps, one of the easiest skins to reproduce in its grain
features and solid character, though the imitations are
easily detected by immersing a piece of the suspected
leather in water until saturated, then pulling it out with
the hands to stretch when the grain, which is produced by
embossing, will disappear, while the true hog grain will
remain showing clear hair holes through from grain to
flesh. A hog-skin may be said to be practically fibreless,
approaching nearer to a piece of tough gristle than anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
else. In the raw state the skins are shipped from
southern Europe, Danubian and Balkan States, China
and the East generally, while North America has an
almost unlimited supply, but Scotland produces the finest
and most esteemed. In size they vary considerably, like
all skin supplies, but a most useful skin for binders&#8217; use
will contain about 11 to 12 square feet. Slow oak-bark
tanning is most suitable for this class of skin. Sumach
may with advantage be employed after tanning to prepare
them for the &#8220;dressing&#8221; or &#8220;finishing&#8221; process, but
no mechanical or chemical means should be employed to
overcome a too gristly nature, otherwise its unique capacity
to withstand the act of attrition is proportionately
decreased, or if some similar means are adopted to attain
evenness of shade in dyeing, the same result may be
expected: therefore, so far as it is practicable, this skin
should be used in its natural state, if full durability is
required.</p>

<p>Pigskins containing 11 to 12 square feet may be
purchased, according to their quality and degree of
manufacture, from 8d. to 1s. 4d. per square foot.</p>

<p>What with bad paper and bad leather, the librarian
of the present is confronted with two serious
problems. In spite of the Society of Arts&#8217; adverse criticism
in 1898, much paper is still made of mechanical
wood pulp, and more badly overloaded with clay, in
both cases causing much anxiety and expenditure to the
librarian who attempts to cope successfully with the
defect. The soft, spongy leaves, like blotting-paper, that
are chiefly composed of wood pulp, can best be dealt
with in the very expensive way of inlaying each page in
a surround of sound, true paper. But there is another
expedient, which I have not tried, which may to some
extent be useful; it is to enclose each leaf within a network
of fine open silk net, made on purpose. In either
case re-sewing and re-binding is necessary.</p>

<p>With regard to the clay-laden paper on which many
books are printed, the case is equally serious and equally
costly. Fine monotone illustrations produced by the
half-tone method, and colour illustrations produced by
the three-colour process, are now always made on this
sort of paper, which has a beautifully fine and even
surface. The paper, however, will not allow any stitching
to keep it in place, so it rapidly falls out. Then it has
either to be inlaid in a sound paper surround or else
entirely mounted on a sound piece of paper or jaconet;
and if there are many plates this involves re-binding and
an ugly thickening of the book. There is, however, a
new method, which may prove of real value: the actual
print is made on a very thin paper, which is at once laid
down on a sound sheet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>All these operations are expensive as at present
provided for in most libraries. They require great care
and skill, and take a long time; and it may safely be said
that any trustworthy binder entrusted with such work,
which is quite out of the ordinary schedule, is fully justified
in charging highly for it. The necessary materials are,
however, quite simple, so that if there should be a skilled
binder on the staff, all such work can practically be done
and counted at the cost of time-work only&mdash;an immense
saving.</p>

<p>There are numerous other small accidents which befall
books in all public libraries about which the same things
may be said&mdash;accidental ink-spots, leaves crushed from a
fall, torn places, cut places, damp or wet marks found
out in time; all these are expensive to send out and cheap
to do on the premises. Besides this, in many cases such
as ink-stains or wet an immediate treatment is often quite
successful, whereas a delayed treatment can rarely be so.</p>

<p>All this comes under the category of small repairs;
but there are other matters which rank a little higher
in the bookbinding world which can also be easily and
effectively done by a resident binder with few appliances.
In all libraries there are a number of pamphlets and thin
books which come under the usual binder&#8217;s schedule at
a fair price, but which, if dealt with by the &#8220;stabbed&#8221;
method on the premises, will be equally strong at
about one-third the cost. An ordinary octavo periodical,
measuring 10 by 7 inches, and 1-1/4 inches thick, can, with
the help of a cheap stabbing machine, be strongly and
effectively bound for about 10d., with boards, cloth
back, paper sides, and lettered in hand type on a paper
label. I showed a specimen to the Library Association
on Dec. 18, 1902, when I read a paper on the subject, and
it was much approved. I do not advise the stabbing for
a book of value, but it does admirably for unimportant
books, and is quick and easy to do.</p>

<p>It might be worth pointing out that in binding in
this way a collection of pamphlets of the same size, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
collection can easily be taken to pieces for insertion of
a new piece, if required, without further injury to the
pamphlets already stabbed.</p>

<p>Next to this comes binding proper, books sewn with
sewn-in bands or flexible, then properly forwarded and
finished. This is all skilled work, and if any library is
able to afford it there is no question but that a large
saving would be effected, both in money and in efficiency,
if it would set up a small bindery of its own. I think,
however, that it would not be wise to set up such a
bindery unless some member of the superior staff has
gone through the binding shops and is able to bind a
book properly himself. [N.B.&mdash;In London the practical
knowledge is very difficult to obtain, as the Technical
Education Board of the London County Council does not
admit amateurs.] Without this knowledge it is impossible
to know whether a book is truly or fraudulently bound.</p>

<p>A very common fault is that binders will not draw the
ends of the bands of a book properly in to the boards.
They cut off the ends of the bands or scrape them so
thin that they are of no strength&mdash;this is done so that the
joint should look quite flat. The result is that when the
cloth, buckram, or leather with which the back is covered,
gives way, off come the boards; the book is then sent to
a binder, who sticks a new strip of leather along the back,
and letters it, and charges the same as for re-binding, the
operation is done by one&#8217;s own binder with own leather,
costing about a few pence only. In a properly forwarded
book with the bands properly drawn in, the boards are
very securely fastened and may well remain so for hundreds
of years, irrespective of whatever substance is used
to cover the back. If the sewing of an old book is still
sound, but the ends of the bands are broken off, new bands
can be added by means of tape glued over the old ones
and then fastened on to the boards and properly covered
with a new bit of leather. Sometimes when they are sound,
the remaining ends of old bands will bear a new bit sewn
on to them. In all repairs care should be taken to match<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
any old leather that can be retained as nearly as possible.
The proper sewing and forwarding of the book is the
integral part of the binding, the outer covering is of little
real use except for the protection of the threads which in
the case of a flexible sewn book would soon wear through
if not enclosed. The outer covering of a book, however,
has great decorative possibilities and has been for centuries
a much valued field for designers, jewellers,
enamellers, goldsmiths, and workers in blind and gold
tooling. Much fine decorative work done on modern calf
and bright coloured leathers will probably perish in a
very few years.</p>

<p>The question, therefore, of quality and soundness of
the leather used for covering the proper sewing of a book
is of much importance. There is strong need for sound
leather, which is difficult to get, and ordinary persons,
even bookbinders and librarians themselves, cannot by a
simple inspection discriminate between new good leather
and new bad leather because there is no apparent
difference.</p>

<p>We are in the hands of our leather merchants, and
although several firms are now willing to sell leathers
under guarantee of freedom from sulphuric acid, all are
not yet so inclined. I should advise all librarians who do
their own binding to accept no leather without a written
guarantee of freedom from sulphuric acid, and even then
I should send a cutting to Dr. Parker for examination.</p>

<p>With regard to the trade aspect of employing a
binder directly to work on a time agreement, I am
authoritatively informed that, provided the workman is
paid the full trade union wage, and properly located,
there is no objection to his employment in this manner.
On the other hand, as I have hinted before, I think
that such a workman requires some skilled supervision,
so here, again, I would urge that in every library one
of the superior staff should be a competent binder himself.
Given such a skilled supervisor and a small
body of skilled binders under his authority, there is no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
doubt whatever that much money would be saved in
the administration of any library, and a multitude of
invaluable small repairs would be possible, which under
ordinary conditions must be left alone to accumulate
and get worse and worse.</p>

<p>I am pleased to say that there are already valuable
corroborations of this view in actual working, and
I am permitted to cite the case of the Hull Public
Library, whose report on the binding for 1901 is before
me. During this year I find that the work done comprised&mdash;</p>

<p>The mere enumeration of these materials shows the
immense value of the system, enabling the administration
to accomplish numbers of small repairs, each of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
which would have cost very much more if they had
been done by an outside bookbinder.</p>

<p>The report for 1902 is similar, but the sum spent is
£396 1s. 11d., and the work done was&mdash;</p>

<ul class="index">
<li>3,756 volumes bound (all sizes) average 1s. 7-1/3d.

<p>In 1903 we find an expenditure of £397 7s. 4d., and

<p>The increased cost in binding &#8220;is principally owing
to extra labour incurred in preparing the books for sewing,
necessary in consequence of the poor quality of paper on
which books are now printed, and the method of sewing
adopted by publishers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here we begin to find the result of the bad paper of
to-day, and we must also note the warning to publishers
contained in the last paragraph. I can thoroughly endorse
it, and I know that nine out of ten new books are so badly
put together that it takes a long time and much trouble
to pull them to pieces before they can be properly sewn.</p>

<p>For 1904 there is an expenditure of £416 16s. 6d.,
and the work done&mdash;4,352 volumes bound (average cost
1s. 8-1/2d. per vol.), and various items of mounting ordnance
maps, always a very expensive operation, re-sewing,
lettering, and miscellaneous repairs, all very necessary
and, if sent out, very costly. It will be noted that the
cost of binding per volume is steadily increasing, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
this not because the work is better done, but because
of the bad quality of the paper and sewing as sent out by
publishers. Books are sent out fastened by little wire
clips, which rust, and have to be very carefully extracted
before a book can be properly sewn. These little clips
are abominations, and the process of removing them,
however carefully done, is likely to cause damage which
must be repaired in its turn. Then machine sewing has
not yet reached its final stage; there is a difficulty about
the return of one of the threads, and it is clumsily brought
back by tearing through the upper and lower extremities
of each section. This damage is glued up and hidden by
a head-band stuck on, but when the book is pulled so
that it may be properly sewn, the torn parts have to be
laboriously mended.</p>

<p>My thanks are due to Mr. William F. Lawton, the
librarian of the Hull Public Libraries, who has most
courteously given me the particulars I asked him for;
and he tells me further that his books are all half-bound,
mostly in sealskin&mdash;a very valuable leather;
also that he is getting a far better binding both as
regards the quality of the materials used and the
highest average he mentions, 1s. 8-1/2d. per volume for a
satisfactory binding must be something of a revelation to
most librarians, whose average, even if they employ the
cheapest binder in their neighbourhood, must be very
much higher than this, and in all likelihood the work
and materials not in any way near the same standard
of excellence.</p>

<p>There is another point about an old library which is
of much importance, and for which the services of a
regular working binder are invaluable. This is the
periodical cleaning and polishing of books. It is no use
to try to clean old books with water; it will do more
harm than good. But until some competent chemist
chooses to suggest a proper dressing, it will be found
that a good furniture polish is excellent for the purpose.
Among the several skilled members employed in my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
library, one of the best is always cleaning and polishing
old books; in fact, old leather really requires some sort
of feeding to keep it in sound condition, and the state of
perfect repair in which numbers of 15th century books
and books of about that date still are is a remarkable
testimony to the excellence of old systems of preparing
leather and its permanence if carefully kept. Calf, vellum,
and goat-skin all last splendidly, but all do better if kept
in the dark and under glass; and it must never be forgotten
that damp is one of the worst enemies of both
paper and leather. Bookcases should never touch an
outer wall, but a ventilation space should always be left
between the wall and the back of the bookcase. This
should even be done when the bookcase abuts on an
inner wall. Bookshelves should never be cleaned or
washed with water&mdash;only use furniture polish; and vellum
books should be kept with their backs inwards, the title,
if necessary, being written on the fore-edge. Old vellum
books were usually kept so in olden times, as light makes
vellum brittle like egg-shell.</p>

<p>Books should be close enough on a shelf to support
each other; they should not be allowed to flop about;
if they are there will be a tendency to fall away from the
upper bands, especially in the case of large books. A
simple angle iron, the lower wing being inserted under
the last few books on a shelf not full, will enable the
books to be kept always at the proper lateral pressure.</p>

<p>Big books, such as newspapers, should have a strong
handle loop of leather bound in, coming out about the
middle of the back.</p>

<p>The following practical hints may be found useful
when repairs are required to books in libraries. It
is, however, necessary that the librarian or his assistants
should gain some technical knowledge of bookbinding,
as this will enable them to execute small repairs, which,
if promptly done, will probably prevent the expense of
rebinding.</p>

<p>The repairing room or small bindery should be not
less than 12 feet square, and should have a good natural
light. The &#8220;plant&#8221; required will be as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> A few stout millboards of the same size as the wooden pressing boards will be
required for placing between the books when more than one book is pressed at a time,
the wooden pressing boards being used for the top and bottom books. These can be made
by pasting together two tenpenny millboards; line each side with stout smooth paper,
trim the edges of the boards, so that they are square.</p></div>


<p><i>To repair torn leaves.</i>&mdash;Paste the edges of the parts
torn very neatly, using a little paste, place a piece of
tissue paper under the torn part, carefully join the parts,
and place another piece of tissue paper over the joint;
then place a piece of paper each side of the leaf, and put
a weight upon it until the part is dry, then take away the
loose tissue paper.</p>


<p><i>To insert a loose leaf.</i>&mdash;Flatten the back edge of the
leaf, then place a strip of paper about 1/8 inch from
the edge, and paste that part very neatly, insert it in
the book, placing it as close to the back as possible,
close the book, and place a weight upon it for about
three hours.</p>


<p><i>To replace books in their covers.</i>&mdash;If the cover of a
book is sound, the book can be inserted again in the
following manner:&mdash;If it is necessary, re-sew the book
on tapes, put new end papers made with a strip of wide
linen in the fold, sew these on the book and trim them,
paste the tapes on the end papers, knock up the edges of
the book as evenly as possible (as they will not be cut)
and glue the back, using the glue sparingly, and place a
thin piece of linen round the back extending about 1 inch
on each end paper; put the book under a weight until
the glue is almost dry, then &#8220;round&#8221; it and afterwards
&#8220;back&#8221; it slightly; place the book again under a weight
until the glue is quite dry, glue the back again, and place
the book squarely in the old cover; place a piece of paper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
round the back of the cover, and rub it down with the
bone folder until the back of the cover sticks well to
the book. After about three hours the glue will be dry,
and the book can then be pasted down; open the covers
and paste the end paper facing the board, using the
brush from the centre to the edges; close the covers and
put the book in the nipping press&mdash;the pressing boards
should be placed carefully against the grooves and not
upon them; leave the book in the press for about twelve
hours. When a book does not require re-sewing, new
end papers should be made as stated and sewn on the
book if it has been sewn on tapes; if the book has not
been sewn on tapes, the end papers should be edged
on in the same manner as the loose leaf, and in these
instances the linen should be placed in the fold of the
end papers.</p>

<p>Old books which have been bound in leather generally
require repairs to the corners and the back, these being
the parts which first show signs of decay. Carefully cut
away the ragged edges of the old leather along the joints
at the back and also the corners; strip the leather off the
back and soak it off if necessary, so that the back is quite
clean; also take away the old leather from the corners,
lift up the edges of the leather along the joints and also
at the corners about 1 inch, turn the leather back, and
place a thin piece of wooden trindle under the fold, and
pare the edges of the leather neatly; if the millboard at
the corners is broken, open the edges and rub in some
glue, press the edges together, and, when nearly dry,
hammer them flat on the &#8220;knocking-down iron,&#8221; obtain
some leather to match the old binding, put a new back,
also corners where necessary, on the book, paring the
edges of the leather neatly; after these are quite dry,
the edges of the old leather should be pasted down to
overlap the new leather; wash any smears of paste away,
and press the book lightly in the nipping press; new end
papers should be edged in as in the case of the loose leaf:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
trim them to the size of the book and then paste them
down, but with the boards open until they are quite
dry; place either a tin or a glazed cardboard inside
the covers, and keep the book pressed in the nipping
press for about six hours.</p>

<p>We first introduced this material to the notice of Bookbinders
some 25 years ago. Since then it has steadily increased in
popularity, as its durability and utility have been demonstrated
by this test of a quarter of a century.</p>

<p class="ph3"><span class="u"><i>WHEREVER HARD WEAR IS WANTED PIGSKIN<br />
IS THE RIGHT THING IN THE RIGHT PLACE.</i></span></p>

<p>It is not a fibrous substance as other leather is, but naturally
of a compact, gristly character. When skilfully tanned and treated
for the purpose, it unquestionably is the best of bookbinding leather.</p>

<p>See Sample of our Pigskin on End Cover.</p>

<p>Available in all colours and substances. Please write for
full particulars.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
